# Introduction

The purpose of my YouTube Download script was to download the highest-quality YouTube video available from a given link, which is prompted for at the time the script is ran. It can download 4K60FPS videos, which is something websites do NOT offer free of charge.

# How To Use

If you would like to use the script, please follow these steps:
1. Download the code from GitHub.
2. Install the necessary package using the command found below.
```
pip install yt_dlp
``` 
3. Copy the link of a YouTube video you would like to use (I used the classic, [Nyan Cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4), for my example).
4. Run the <b>ytd.py</b> script.
5. Once the script is done running, view the downloaded video in the same folder you ran the script from.
